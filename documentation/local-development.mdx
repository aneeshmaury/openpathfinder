## Introduction

OpenPathFinder's codebase is set up in a Next JS application

Here's the repo structure:

```
/root
├── app
├── components
├── documentation
├── public
├── styles
├── types
```


The `/root` directory contains the code:

- `app`: The entire pages of application and their layouts.
- `components`: Contains all the components which is used in codebase like header, about, blogs, etc.
- `documentation`: Contains all the docs file related to the codebase and project.
- `public`: Contains all the public files like logos and other images.
- `styles`: Contains all the css files related to designing and defaults.
- `types`: Contains all the files where types of object is defined for the codebase.


## How `OpenPathFinder App` works

OpenPathFinder's app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

It also utilizes the code from the `components` directory, specially for UI and blocks.

All of the code for the web app is located in the `root` directory.

There's also the API server, which is located in here: `/app/api`

When you run `pnpm dev` to start the development server, the app will be available at http://localhost:3000.


## Running OpenPathFinder locally

To run OpenPathFinder locally, you'll need to set up the following:

- A [MongoDB account](https://www.mongodb.com/) account

## Step 1: Local setup

First, you'll need to clone the OpenPathFinder repo and install the dependencies.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Clone the repo">

First, clone the [OpenPathFinder repo](https://github.com/rohankumarchaudhary67/openpathfinder) into a public GitHub repository.

    ```bash Terminal
    git clone https://github.com/rohankumarchaudhary67/openpathfinder
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    Run the following command to install the dependencies:

    ```bash Terminal
    pnpm i
    ```

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect with MongoDB database

First, Open the MongoDB account and get the url for connection of mongodb with your password in the url.

Then, Create a `.env.local` file for your local environment and paste the url like that

```.env.local file
MONGO_URI:"paste-your-url-here"
```

## Step 3: Start the development server

Finally, you can start the development server. This will build the packages + start the app servers.

```bash Terminal
pnpm dev
```

The web app will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
